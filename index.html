    <h1>So, how 'bout them Knicks?</h1>
    <p>What are their names? I'm Santa Claus! This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry! Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love!</p>
    <p>Say it in Russian! This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry! <strong> Dr.</strong> <em> Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense.</em> But, okay!</p>
    <h2>Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty?</h2>
    <p>For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist! Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew. You know, I was God once. Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood!</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Yes! In your face, Gandhi!</li><li>So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct?</li><li>Who are those horrible orange men?</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera.</h3>
    <p>Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried? I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume? Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Shinier than yours, meatbag.</li><li>Actually, that's still true.</li><li>Of all the friends I've had… you're the first.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>And I'm his friend Jesus. Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs? Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it. Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig".</p>
    <p>Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions? Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? Soon enough. That's not soon enough! You're going to do his laundry?</p>
    <p>We're also Santa Claus! Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? Can we have Bender Burgers again? You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus? Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried?</p>
    <p>Shinier than yours, meatbag. Yes! In your face, Gandhi! No argument here. I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions?</p>
    <p>I just told you! You've killed me! Can I use the gun? No, she'll probably make me do it. With gusto.</p>
    <p>I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually? Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet.</p>
    <p>Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig". Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor. I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun!</p>
    <p>I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense. Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate.</p>
    <p>And why did 'I' have to take a cab? Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very… Oh right. I forgot about the battle. Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here.</p>
    <p>Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer. That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing. Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient?</p>
    <p>Moving along… Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. Bender, quit destroying the universe! Who are you, my warranty?!</p>
